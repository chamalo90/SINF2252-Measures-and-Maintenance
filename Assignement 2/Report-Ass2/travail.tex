\section{Introduction}
For the first assignment, we had to analyse the code quality of the Petit-Parser framework project. Since we had to perform this analysis manually and Petit-Parser is a quite large framework, it was a hard job to go through all the code and analysis wasn't perfect because there were too many lines of code to read through. \\
In this report, we will use some Moose tools to perform an automated code analysis of the same system. Our conclusion in the first report were optimistic about Petit-Parser even if we found some bad smells. Let's see if our previous conclusions are still valid after a deeper analysis with some metrics.

\section{Overview}
\subsection{The Moose Pyramid}
The first tool given by Moose that is visualizing feature which gives a pyramid containing general metrics of the overall system.

In this pyramid, you can observe three main blocks: one on the top and two at each side of the bottom. \\
The block on the top, in green, gives metrics about inheritance measurements.
