\section{Introduction}
For the first assignment, we had to analyse the code quality of the Petit-Parser framework project. Since we had to perform this analysis manually and Petit-Parser is a quite large framework, it was a hard job to go through all the code and analysis wasn't perfect because there were too many lines of code to read through. \\
In this report, we will use some Moose tools to perform an automated code analysis of the same system. Our conclusion in the first report were optimistic about Petit-Parser even if we found some bad smells. Let's see if our previous conclusions are still valid after a deeper analysis with some metrics.

\section{Overview}
\subsection{The Moose Pyramid}
The first tool given by Moose that is visualizing feature which gives a pyramid containing general metrics of the overall system. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
\label{pyramid}
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{overview.png}
\caption{Overview Pyramid}
\end{figure}
In this pyramid, you can observe three main blocks: one on the top and two at each side of the bottom. \\
The block on the top, in green, gives metrics about inheritance measurements. The first metric is the average number of derived classes. The little red square at the corner of this metric cell tells us that the computed number given is higher than what is known as a normal value. This could be explained. Since \textsc{PetitParser} is a framework for parsing several languages, his model is quite complex and need a large number of derived class dedicated to each kind of parsing strategy. The second metric is the average hierarchy height. Moose tells use that the value computed is close to average. Mixing the results of these two values, we can conclude that \textsc{PetitParser} uses a large number of classes which are derived in a number of levels which are still reasonable.\\
The block at the bottom left side gives several metrics about the size. The first metric shown is the number of packages. The number computed is lower than what would be expected for such a framework. But, as we already navigate manually through the code, we can say that strict rules are respected to build packages. These packages sometimes contain a large number of classes, especially the ones with tests and with parser types. The number of packages metric can be a bit distorted for this kind of framework. The second metric represents the number of classes. This time, the number is too high. To understand why this result could be a bad smell, we went back to the system browser. We saw that packages are mostly divided in two categories. There are packages that are almost empty. A very short number of classes are implemented. There are also packages with a way too many classes. After searching why these packages are too big, we found that the classes they put in them were still logically managed.  For instance, \textit{PetitParser-Parsers} package contains a large number of classes but these classes must be in this package. They are describing the different parsing strategies for the different types of parsers. The next metric is the number of methods. The number is a bit lower than what is expected. This observation comes from the fact that we have a large number of derived class. Some methods are written in a class higher in the hierarchy and don't need to be defined in all subclasses anymore. The last metric we'll take a look at is the number of lines of code. \textsc{PetitParser} seems to have this number in the average for Smalltalk projects.

\subsection{System complexity}
Before going deeper in the code, it is very interesting to identify which classes are worst than others.  To visualize this, we give, below, the System Complexity of \textsc{PetitParser}.
The height of the arrow symbolize the number of methods and the width symbolize the number of variables.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\label{system_complexity}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{system_complexity.png}
\caption{System Complexity}
\end{figure}
From left to right, we show : PPAbstractParserTest,PPParser, PJASTNode, SQLASTNode and Petit Analyzer code.  Other smalls arrows are objects from PetitParser or from SmallTalk.
We see that PPAbstractParserTest and PPParser are worst than other.  In fact, when we browse the code of this two classes, we understand the schema : for the test part, the creator of PetitParser add all his tests methods in one class.  In other hand, for the PPParser classes, and particulary for PPJavaSyntax and PetitSQLiteGrammar, he put all the variables in the same class.  When we now the syntax for Java and SQlite, we understand that the number of variables must be very important.
This graph also shows that the core of the PetitParser system is well efficient regarding to the complexity of this system.

\subsection{Blueprints Complexity}
An other tool to analyze \textsc{PetitParser} is Blueprint.  With this tool, we can show invocation of methods, access of attributes and how methods and attributes interact.\\
As we have seen before with the System complexity, the tests classes are not very efficient and we prefer to focalize on the Core of \textsc{PetitParser}.  So, you can find below a schema representing the Blueprint Complexity of \textsc{PetitParser} classes and its ecosystem.\\
\begin{figure}[ht]
\label{blueprint_system}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{blueprint_petit_parser.png}
\caption{Blueprint Complexity of PetitParser packages}
\end{figure}
This schema contains arrows representing classes and his hierarchy.  In each arrow, we found 5 columns corresponding of differents entities we found in a class.  So from left to right, we found initialization, public methods, private methods, accessors and attributes.  In each column, we have also arrows representing the entity of this type in the class.  We found also, crossing columns, dark and light blue links.  The dark link represent the invocation of methods and the light represent access to attributes.\\

In this schema, at first glance, we see that the arrow, and his tree, in the middle is the main class of \textsc{PetitParser}.  The class call \textsc{PetitParser} and, indeed, it is the main class of the project. \\

\subsubsection{Blueprints Complexity of PetitParser}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\label{blueprint_pparser}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{blueprint_pparser.png}
\caption{Blueprint Complexity of PetitParser class}
\end{figure}
In the schema we can see more clearly the arrow representing \textsc{PetitParser} class.\\
Based on the legend explained above, we found that it contains no accessors and one attribute, \textsc{properties} which is a instanceVariable.  Some methods, public or private access directly to this attribute.  In theorical view, it's not good to access directly, you must prefer to use accessor.  With accessor, you can validate the information before setting your attributes.  Of course, it is less important for private method if you are very carefull when you use an attribute.  But, for public method, you must use a attribute.
Of course, it's a theorical view and we look all methods accessing directly the attribute before getting more analysis.  We have found 5 methods : 
\begin{itemize}
	\item removeProperty: aKey ifAbsent: aBlock : this private method 	remove the property with aKey.  If a key is found, it returns the associated value and the the result of evaluating aBlock otherwise.  According to the code, we can say that this method is a safe method for the attribute : it removes the key if, and only if, the key exists.  With this solution, the integrity of the attribute is checked;
	\item propertyAt: aKey put: anObject : this private method change the object (anObject) linked to the key (aKey) in the property.  if aKey is not found, it creates a new entry.  Again, we see that this method is a safe method and the integrity of the attribute is checked;
	\item propertyAt: aKey ifAbsent: aBlock : this private method give the value associated to aKey if aKey is a key in property and answer the result of evaluating aBlock otherwise.  Like the first method, we see that the integrity of the attribute is checked ;
	\item postCopy : this public method give a copy of the property.  To perform this copy, it is normal to access to the attribute but, for a public method, it's preferable to use a getter, event if we don't change it ;
	\item hasProperty: aKey : this public method test if aKey is a key in the property.  Also, like the previous public method, the integrity of the attribute is checked but it's not good to access directly to an attribute in a public method.
\end{itemize}
In ddition to checking the code of methods, it is interesting to note that this methods are well used by this class or children classes.\\
Even if the integrity of the attribute is checked in every method accessing directly to the attribute, we see that almost method performs a test on property.  Why the creator doesn't use the test method in other methods listed below ? \\
Finally, we see that some methods are setter for property.  Because property contains keys and values, the creator can not do a "simple" setter to change the property but he create method to add or remove (key,value).  So, in conclusion, we can see that it's important to check the code after reading this schema and, evenf if we found no getter and setter, the most methods accessing directly the attribute are setter and getter for the structure of property.\\

For the dark blue links, we see that a lot of methods are linked together.  It's a signe that the code are modulable and reduce code duplication.  It is also the consequence of the \textsc{PetitParser} system : it uses structures with childrens and list of object.  To access these structures,  methods use these sub-structures and methods related to them.\\

Finally, we see some brown arrows.  It means that the method override code.  AND ???? \\

Moi, Moose me renvoit un schéma vide, WTF ?

\subsection{Bad smells}
With the Moose tool, we can have metrics about almost everything but they are not all relevant to detect bad smells.  To Detect more precisly some bad smells, we have created some query to get bad methods.\\

\subsubsection{Number of lines of Code}
First, we want to see methods where the number of lines of codes is bigger than 50, we can query :
\begin{lstlisting}
each numberOfLinesOfCode>50
\end{lstlisting}
With this query, we can see that, in the \textsc{PetitParser} System, we found 7 classes with more than 50 lines of codes.\\

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\label{system_complexity_big_classes}
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{system_complexity_big_methods.png}
\caption{Complexity of big classes}
\end{figure}
In the schema below, we can see that the class PPParser is the bigger one, with 758 lines of codes.  To go depper in the analysis, we can perform the query for this class and we see \todo{plante chez moi}\\
\subsubsection{Accessors}
An other interresting metric is the number of getter and setter for one attribute.  In mai ncase, you must have one getter and one setter for every attribute.  We see before that, for some attributes, we don't have any accessors. \\
\begin{lstlisting}
each numberOfAccessorMethods >= ( 2 * each numberOfAttributes ) 
\end{lstlisting}
This query return 22 classes and we can visualize these with the blueprint schema.\\
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\label{more_access_blueprint}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{more_access_blueprint.png}
\caption{Blueprint of classes with more accessors than 2* attributes}
\end{figure}
Here we can notice that almost classes have 2 accessors methods for one attribute, except the PPFailingParser class with one attribute and 3 accessors.  In fact, when we analyze the code, we see that we have one getter, one setter and one method to show the attribute because the attribute is a message with a specific format who are not very readable.  Like earlier in this report, we see a lot of light blue links, that symbolize an access to a attribute without accessors. As the query used indicate that we have, at least, two accessors, it is a bad smell to access direclty attributes and don't use accessors.  In particulary, in the class PPFailingParser, we have three accessors and some methods access directly the attribute.\\

At the opposite of the previous query, we can listing all classes with less than 2 accessors per attribute.
\begin{lstlisting}
each numberOfAccessorMethods < ( 2 * each numberOfAttributes ) 
\end{lstlisting}
This query return 15 classes and we can visualize these with the blueprint schema.\\
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\label{less_access_blueprint}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{less_access_blueprint.png}
\caption{Blueprint of classes with less accessors than 2* attributes}
\end{figure}
The number of classes are smaller but, again, we see a lot of light blue links.  For the biggest arrow, we have already analysing this in a previous section because it represent PPParser class.  For the others classes, we see that some of them have a lot of light blue links, like the arrow on the left of PPParser.  It is the PPToken class every methods (privete or public) access directly to attributes.  When we analyze the code of this class, we see that almost methods just read attributes but when you have accessors to do that, why access directly ?  It's also not very good for maintenance.  If you change your attribute (other type or the way you store key/value), you must refactoring alls methods accessing directly to this attribute.  According to this blueprint schema, we  see that it will be a big work.\\


\subsubsection{High parameter number}
An other interesting metric is the number of parameter for every method and, in particular, find methods with a high number of parameters.  This is a very interesting metric beacause method receiving a lot of parameters can be defficult to read and we can assume that lot paramters indicate a method performing too much work.  We can also assume that all paramters can be grouped in a object, where parameters are related.  Using object rather than parameters are very usefull if you change the way you represent paramters in this object.  If it is only passed in parameter, you must change more than if you use object.\\
To find methods with a lot of parameters, we use this query :

\begin{lstlisting}
each numberOfParameters > aNumber
\end{lstlisting}
Because the number of parameters can vary depending on the program, we have performed this query for aNumber form 0 until we have no methods.  We found that 6 is the highest parameter number. \\ \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
  \hline
  aNumber& Number of methods \\
  \hline
  0 & 2216 \\
  1 & 472 \\
  2 & 105 \\
  3 & 32 \\
  4 & 10 \\
  5 & 3 \\
  6 & 1 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
We clearly see that the number of methods decrease when we increase the number of parameters.  It is also very interesting to see that the highest parameter number is 6, a small number.  To go deeper in our measure, we analyse the code of the metho with 6 parameters :  "matchList" in the PetitAnalyzer package from PPParser.\\
The header of this method is :
\begin{lstlisting}
matchList: matchList index: matchIndex against: parserList index: parserIndex inContext: aDictionary seen: aSet
\end{lstlisting}

As say before, this is not very readable.  Also, we found a long method (35 lines) with no comments which does not help in understanding.  A manual analysis of the code explain us that it is a method testing if two list match (\todo{je suis pas sur :p}).  So, we can group parameters about list in one object.  With this solution, we can reduce the parameters number but mainly augment the cohesion in adding method directly in the object.  It is also more efficient when you want to use this method : with an object, you give just the object, you don't want to pass each parameter and try to have found every parameter before using this method.  it is very relevant because we found that this method is access in 51 methods.\\

\subsubsection{Brain and god classes}
A brain method or class is a method or a class that do too much work.  In general, we try to avoid such methods in programs because such methods are very specific, impossible to reuse and it is very difficult to maintain the code.  In general, it's the signe that your programs are not very modulable and you can improve your program by splitting these methods in several smaller methods.\\
To find these methods or classes, we can search for long methods but it's not enough.  We search also methods with a lot of conditionnals.\\ 
\begin{lstlisting}
each numberOfConditionals > aNumber
\end{lstlisting}
Again, aNumber is a variable and we can ajust it to do better analysis.  If we take 5, we found 5 methods, whose the "matchList" method and parseOn method.  It's not a suprise because we have found this method in the large emthods emtrics and in the high parameters number metric.\\
In this 5 methods, we found 3 methods from PetitParser package.  Before qualifing "God class" this class, given the definition of a god class.  According to the litterature, we can qualifing a class a "god class" if it is a complex class with low cohesion and with a high number of outer class accesses.\\
To detect god class, we can use a query but each property of a god class has still analysed.  So, we can say that PPParser is a god class.\\
